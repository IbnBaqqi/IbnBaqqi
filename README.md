<b>Abdulbaki Salaudeen, Junior Software Engineer</b>

I’m currently focused on backend development using Java and Spring Boot, currently building projects and sharpening my skills toward becoming a professional software engineer.

I’ve worked on personal projects like an <a href="https://github.com/IbnBaqqi/storeApi.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">e-commerce API</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/IbnBaqqi/book-me.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">room booking system</a>, and I’m now exploring how to turn one of my ideas into a real startup.

I’m passionate about learning, improving daily, building scalable, high-performance backend systems and tools that make life easier or more fun.
