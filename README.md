<b>Abdulbaki Salaudeen, Junior Software Engineer</b>

I‚Äôm currently focused on backend development using Java and Spring Boot, currently building real-world projects and deepening my skills as I grow into a professional software engineer.

I‚Äôve worked on personal projects like an [e-commerce API](https://github.com/IbnBaqqi/storeApi.git) and a [room booking system](https://github.com/IbnBaqqi/book-me.git), and I‚Äôm now exploring how to turn one of my ideas into a real startup.

I‚Äôm passionate about learning, improving daily, building scalable, high-performance backend systems and tools that make life easier or more fun.
